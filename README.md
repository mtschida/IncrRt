# US-Incarceration-Rates
I scraped U.S. incarceration rates, U.S. crime rates and U.S census data off of the web, made a data set by state and year, then made an initial model on U.S. incarceration rates.

The data folder contains the data.  IT is useful to reproduce the analysis or for other analysis.

"Importing US incarceration and execution data .Rmd" is the R markdown file  that scraped the data from the web.

"Initial Model of US incarceration rates.Rmd" Is the markdown file for the analysis and an initial model.

The HTML files are available for each markdown file.


"Summary of incarceration rate model.pptx" is a brief explanation of the modeling/analysis.
